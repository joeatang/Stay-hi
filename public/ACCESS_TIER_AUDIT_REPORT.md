2. **Discovery** → Limited interactions create scarcity urgency  
3. **Explorer** → First share creates addiction, want unlimited
4. **Beta** → Profile creation builds investment, want permanence
5. **VIP** → Advanced features create dependency, need lifetime access

### Timing-Based Triggers
- 50% time remaining: Gentle upgrade nudge
- 75% time remaining: Feature-specific prompts
- 90% time remaining: Urgency-based conversion
- Expiration: Immediate downgrade with re-upgrade path
