# 🧭 Hi Checkpoint Ledger

> **Hi DEV Protocol**: Tesla-grade project context management  
> *"Stable over flashy. Context over chaos."*

## What This Is

The Hi Checkpoint Ledger maintains authoritative project state for the **Hi App** (Help Inspyre) — our mindfulness/emotional GPS MVP. Each checkpoint captures the complete context needed to onboard new developers, resume work after breaks, or hand off to fresh collaborators.

## Hi Philosophy 

Following **Wozniak/Tesla engineering principles**: Jobs clarity meets Woz execution. Every checkpoint is built for **immediate comprehension** and **zero-assumption handoffs**.

## Files Structure

```
docs/checkpoints/
├── README.md              ← You are here
├── LATEST.md              ← Always current state (overwritten)
├── LATEST.json            ← Machine-readable current state  
├── HISTORY.md             ← Cumulative checkpoint timeline
└── checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md  ← Immutable snapshots
```

## How to Use This Ledger

### 🚀 Starting Fresh (New Chat/Collaborator)

**Option A: Full Context** — Upload or paste `LATEST.md` content  
**Option B: Quick Brief** — Use the "Copy Block for New Chats" capsule from `LATEST.md`  
**Option C: Deep Dive** — Reference specific `checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` for historical context  

### 🔄 Creating New Checkpoints

1. Copy `checkpoint-template.md` (or use `LATEST.md` as base)
2. Update with current project state
3. Save as `checkpoint-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md`
4. Update `LATEST.md` and `LATEST.json` to match
5. Add entry to top of `HISTORY.md`

### 🎯 Hi DEV Standards

- **Guardrails First**: Lead with what NOT to do
- **State Before Strategy**: Current reality before future plans
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: All commands and next actions should be executable
- **Context Completeness**: Assume zero prior knowledge

## Content Standards

### Required Sections
1. **Hi DEV Persona** — Engineering philosophy context
2. **Stack & Structure** — Technical foundation
3. **State** — Current tags, status, guardrails
4. **What's Done** — Concise achievement log
5. **Next Actions** — Authoritative, executable steps
6. **Copy Block** — New chat onboarding capsule

### Hi Branding Elements
- Use "Hi DEV" for engineering persona
- Reference Tesla/Wozniak principles
- Include "Help Inspyre" full project name
- Maintain "stable over flashy" philosophy

## Checkpoint Cadence

Create checkpoints at:
- Major phase completions
- Before/after risky changes
- Handoff points
- Problem resolution
- Pre-deployment states
