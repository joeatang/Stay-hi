# 🌟 Hi-OS v1.1.0 — "Feel the Pulse"

**January 2026 Update**

---

## Hey, Hi Family 👋

We've been busy making Hi simpler, faster, and more joyful. This update focuses on one thing: **getting out of your way so you can focus on what matters — saying hi to yourself.**

Here's everything that's new.

---

## 🏠 The New Dashboard

**What changed:** We cleaned house. The dashboard is now zen-like simple.

**What you'll see:**
- Your **7-day activity streak** (those little dots showing your week)
- The **Hi Medallion** (your daily companion)
- Your **current streak** count
- A daily **Hiffirmation** to inspire you

**Why we did it:** The old dashboard had too much going on. Stats everywhere. Buttons competing for attention. We moved the heavy stuff to its own home (Hi Pulse) so your daily check-in feels calm and focused.

**The vibe:** Open the app. See your streak. Tap the medallion. Done. That's it.

## 💫 Introducing Hi Pulse

**What it is:** Your new stats headquarters. A dedicated page showing the heartbeat of our community.

**What you'll find:**
- **Live Ticker** — Messages scrolling across the top, keeping you connected to what's happening
- **Global Stats** — Total Hi moments shared by everyone, waves sent, active members
- **Your Personal Stats** — Your shares, your streak, your Hi Points

**Why we built it:** You asked for a place to see your impact. To feel connected to the bigger picture. Hi Pulse is that place. It's where data becomes motivation.

**How to get there:** Tap the **💫** icon in your footer navigation (where Hi Gym used to be).

## 🎯 The Medallion — Your Daily Ritual

The medallion is now smarter. Here's how it works:

### First Tap of the Day
Your **daily check-in**. This is the most important tap — it keeps your streak alive and earns you points. You'll see a celebration confirming you've checked in.

### Every Tap After That
Sends a **Hi Wave** into the world. Each tap adds to your wave count and the global wave total. Tap as many times as you want. It feels good.

### Long Hold (Press & Hold)
**This is new.** Hold the medallion for about a second and a menu appears:
- **Share a Hi** — Opens the share sheet to write and post a Hi moment
- **Mind Gym** — Takes you to Hi Gym for emotional journey work

This replaces the old "Drop a Hi" button and gives you quick access to everything from one place.

## 🔄 What's Different

| Before | Now |
|--------|-----|
| "Drop a Hi" button on Hi Island | **Gone.** Use long-hold on medallion instead |
| Hi Gym in footer navigation | **Moved.** Access via long-hold menu or hamburger menu |
| Hi Pulse icon (💫) | **New.** Your stats dashboard |
| Stats scattered on dashboard | **Moved.** Clean dashboard, stats live in Hi Pulse |
| Share success = hope it worked | **New.** Beautiful celebration toast confirms success |

## 📊 Hi Index Card vs Hi Pulse Page

You might notice stats in two places. Here's the difference:

**Hi Index Card** (on Dashboard)
- Quick glance at community momentum
- Shows: Community Hi Index score, your contribution
- Tap it for a modal with more details

**Hi Pulse Page** (💫 tab)
- Full stats experience
- Live ticker, global stats, personal stats
- Your complete analytics home

**Think of it like:** The card is a peek. The page is the deep dive.

## 🏋️ Where's Hi Gym?

**Still here!** We just moved it off the main navigation to reduce clutter.

**How to access Hi Gym:**
1. **Long-hold** the medallion → tap "Mind Gym"
2. **Hamburger menu** (☰) → Hi Gym
3. **Direct link:** stay-hi.vercel.app/hi-muscle.html

Hi Gym is our emotional intelligence trainer — track your journey from how you feel now to how you want to feel. It's powerful. We just didn't need it taking up permanent footer space.

---

## ✨ Why These Changes?

We believe in **calm technology**. Apps that help you without demanding attention. Tools that work with your life, not against it.

The old Hi was getting cluttered. Too many buttons. Too many decisions. This update asks one simple question:

**Did you say hi to yourself today?**

Tap the medallion. That's it. Everything else is optional depth for when you want it.

---

## 🎉 Quick Start Guide

**Your daily routine:**
1. Open Hi
2. Tap the medallion (first tap = check-in ✓)
3. Done!

**Want to do more?**
- Long-hold medallion → Share a Hi or visit Mind Gym
- Tap 💫 → See your stats and the community pulse
- Tap as much as you want → Every wave counts

---

## 💜 Thank You

Every tap. Every share. Every moment you choose to say hi to yourself — it matters. To you. To us. To the world.

This is version 1.1.0. Codename: **"Feel the Pulse."**

We're just getting started.

**Say hi to yourself. For real.**

— Joe & The Hi Team
