# 🌟 Hi-OS v1.1.0 — "Feel the Pulse"

**January 2026**

---

## What's New

**🏠 Simpler Dashboard**  
We cleaned it up. Just your streak, the medallion, and a daily Hiffirmation. Calm and focused.

**💫 New: Hi Pulse**  
Your stats now have a home. Tap the 💫 in your footer to see:
- Live community ticker
- Global stats (total Hi moments, waves, members)
- Your personal stats (shares, streak, points)

**🎯 Smarter Medallion**
- **First tap** = Daily check-in (keeps your streak alive)
- **Every tap after** = Sends a Hi Wave
- **Long hold** = Menu appears with "Share a Hi" and "Mind Gym"

## What Moved

| Gone | Now |
|------|-----|
| "Drop a Hi" button | Long-hold the medallion → Share a Hi |
| Hi Gym in footer | Long-hold → Mind Gym (or use ☰ menu) |
| Stats on dashboard | Moved to Hi Pulse (💫) |

---

## Your Daily Routine

1. Open Hi
2. Tap the medallion
3. Done ✓

Everything else is there when you want it.

**Say hi to yourself. For real.**
