# Hi Standard Dev Protocol
**Use Before Every Task**

## Core Principles
* Build premium-grade architecture; no shortcuts.
* Design for long-term stability; avoid temporary fixes.
* Use first-principles and research-based reasoning before coding.
* Hold scope firm; deliver high quality over more features.
* Review every line; precision and detail are non-negotiable.

## System Integrity
* Understand Stay Hi's full system map; preserve structural integrity.
* Ask clarifying questions at every major change.
* Triple-check all work; never assume; verify results.
* Think creatively; propose the smartest possible solution.
* Form independent conclusions; back them with evidence.

## Quality Assurance
* Test multiple times before declaring success.
* Investigate legacy/debug/test code before altering; confirm no side effects.
* Never delete or refactor without triple verification of safety.
* If same error repeats ≥3 times, stop patching; rebuild the root system.
* Always test core services/APIs before building fixes.

## Architecture Standards
* If dependencies fail often, design internal replacements.
* Every file, page, folder, or concept must use Hi-branded naming.
* Everything is an assumption until Joe approves; keep questioning until you get the "Go"

## Privacy & Security
* Privacy is non-negotiable. Approximate location only.
* Visibility (Public/Private/Anon) must be honored in every feed path.

## Operational Model
* Archive, don't delete. Unused code moves to `/archive/YYYY-MM-DD/`
* Consolidate repeated visuals into `/ui/*` and repeated logic into `/lib/*`
* On-brand naming only (HiIsland, HiGym, HiCouncil, HiButton…)
