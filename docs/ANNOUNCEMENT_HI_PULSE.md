## One More Thing...

We've been working on something new. Something that lets you feel the heartbeat of our entire community.

Today, we're introducing **Hi Pulse**.

---

## Feel the Beat

Open Hi Pulse and you'll see it immediately — a live ticker scrolling across the top of your screen. Real-time updates. The pulse of positivity.

Below that? Your stats. The community's stats. Everything you need to see your impact.

**Your shares. Your streak. Your points.**

All in one beautiful place.

---

## Share from Anywhere

We've unified the sharing experience. Whether you're on your Dashboard, exploring Hi Island, training in Hi Gym, or checking Hi Pulse — the share experience is identical.

Tap share. Write your Hi moment. Hit submit.

You'll see a beautiful celebration confirming it worked. No more guessing.

## Faster. Smoother. Better.

We've obsessed over every millisecond. Pages load faster. Animations are smoother. The whole experience just *feels* right.

Because details matter. Every single one.

---

## Thank You

To everyone who's been on this journey with us — thank you. Every Hi moment you share makes the world a little brighter.

This is just the beginning.

**Say hi to yourself. For real.**

— Joe & The Hi Team
