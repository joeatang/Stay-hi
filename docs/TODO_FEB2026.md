## 🎯 PRIORITY THIS MONTH

### 🏆 TOP 3 FOCUS AREAS (Feb 2026)

1. **🚀 Launch-Ready Polish** - Fix remaining critical bugs, complete Capacitor/App Store prep
2. **📊 Analytics v2.0** - Complete Patterns + Milestones tabs (80% done, finish it!)
3. **🎁 User Retention** - PWA install push, bulk 1-year upgrade for current users

## 🔴 P0 — CRITICAL BUGS (Fix First Week)

### #19 Auth Session Loss on Phone Sleep 🔥
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (80% solved via Jan fixes)  
**What happened in Jan:**
- ✅ Fixed severe zombie mode with optimistic auth + HiStateResilience.js
- ✅ 80% reduction in session loss cases
- ❌ Safari still kills JS engine on background (~5-10% of cases)

**Remaining work:**
- [ ] Complete Capacitor native wrapper to eliminate final 5-10% (Phase 1B-2A-3A started)
- [ ] iOS App Store submission (wrapper eliminates JS engine kill issue)
- [ ] Add "Install PWA" prompt before shipping native app

**Why this is P0:** Core experience blocker for mobile users  
**Timeline:** 1 week (Capacitor wrapper completion)  
**Location:** See CAPACITOR_SETUP_GUIDE.md, PWA_PRODUCTION_READY.md

---

### #21 Mission Control: degenmentality Can't Generate Codes 🔥
**Status:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION  
**Problem:** Admin gets "need to be verified admin" error  
**Check:**
- [ ] admin_roles table - is user listed?
- [ ] RPC permissions - does generate_invite_code check is_active flag?
- [ ] Does user have is_verified = true in admin_roles?

**Timeline:** 2 hours debug + fix  
**Blocking:** Admin team functionality

---

### #25 Invite Code Expiration Flow — Triple Check
**Status:** DOCUMENTED but needs UX test  
**What we know (from Jan audit):**
- Code expiration ≠ Membership expiration
- User shown "Trial Expired" modal → auto-downgrade to free after 5s
- Re-access via new code or purchase

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Manual test flow: Create code, let expire, verify UX
- [ ] Does user get notification before expiration?
- [ ] Document in user-facing help doc

**Timeline:** 3 hours  
**Why P0:** Must be smooth before public launch

---

### #40 Trac Network Integration (Research) 🔗
**Status:** RESEARCH PHASE  
**Added:** February 5, 2026  
**Complexity:** HIGH  
**Documentation:** See TRAC_NETWORK_COMPATIBILITY_AUDIT.md

**Summary:**
- Trac Network is P2P blockchain (DAG-based, not traditional blockchain)
- Stay Hi is web PWA on Supabase (centralized)
- **Compatibility:** 40-50% overlap, significant architectural differences

**Options:**
1. **Full migration:** 6-12 months, not recommended for R1 (lacks token standards)
2. **Hybrid integration:** 2-4 months, use Trac for specific features (P2P messaging for Hi Wall)
3. **Wait for Mainnet:** 0 effort now, revisit when token standards ready

**Recommendation from audit:** Option 2 (Hybrid) or Option 3 (Wait)
- R1 doesn't support Hi Points tokenization
- Consider Trac for Hi Wall P2P messaging
- Use Trac for content verification proofs

**Next steps:**
- [ ] Read Trac SDK: https://github.com/Trac-Systems/trac-contract-example/
- [ ] Set up local Trac dev environment (if pursuing hybrid)
- [ ] Build proof-of-concept contract for Hi Wall messaging

**Priority:** P4 (research only, not implementation yet)  
**Timeline:** TBD based on Mainnet timeline

---
