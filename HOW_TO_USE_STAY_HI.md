# How to Use the Stay Hi App (Step-by-Step)

## Before You Start (30 seconds)

- You don't need to prepare anything. Just open the app.
- This isn't homework. You can write one word or ten sentences. Both count.
- Your entries are private by default. You choose what (if anything) to share.
- There's no "right way" to do this. You'll figure out your rhythm.
- The app works best when you use it daily, but missing days is fine. You're human.

## The 60-Second First Run

1. **Open the app** — You'll see a simple home screen.
2. **Tap "Get Started"** — No long signup forms. Just the basics.
3. **Pick two emojis** — How you feel now, and how you want to feel. That's your first check-in.
4. **You're done** — The app saved it. You can close it or keep exploring.

That's it. You just used Stay Hi.

## The Daily Flow (2 minutes a day)

### Step 1 — Open the App

**What you'll see:**  
The Home screen with today's date and a simple prompt: "How are you feeling right now?"

**What to do:**  
Just open it. No pressure to do anything yet.

**Why it matters:**  
Showing up is the whole point. Everything else is optional.

### Step 2 — Do a Quick Check-In

**What you'll see:**  
Two emoji pickers side by side. One says "Now," the other says "Goal."

**What to do:**  
Pick an emoji for how you feel right now. Then pick one for how you'd like to feel. Tap "Save."

**Why it matters:**  
This is your emotional baseline for the day. You'll start noticing patterns over time.

### Step 3 — Pick Your "Hi" for Today

**What you'll see:**  
A simple intensity slider or scale (1–5). Labels might say things like "Quiet Day" or "High Energy Day."

**What to do:**  
Slide to match your current energy or mood intensity. Don't overthink it. There's no wrong answer.

**Why it matters:**  
This helps you see your natural rhythms. Some days are 2s. Some are 5s. Both are fine.

### Step 4 — Log a Hi Moment

**What you'll see:**  
A text box with a prompt like "What's one thing from today?" You might also see options to add a photo or location.

**What to do:**  
Write one sentence. Or just a word. Or nothing. If something stood out today — good, bad, or neutral — note it here.

**Why it matters:**  
You'll forget this moment in a week. This is how you remember.

### Step 5 — Leave a Hi Note (optional)

**What you'll see:**  
A longer text field labeled "Hi Note" or "Anything else?"

**What to do:**  
If you want to write more, do it here. If not, skip it.

**Why it matters:**  
Some days you need to process. Some days you don't. This is here when you do.

### Step 6 — Check Your Streak / Progress

**What you'll see:**  
A simple counter or calendar showing how many days you've checked in. Maybe a small "3-day streak" badge or similar.

**What to do:**  
Glance at it. Feel good if you want. Don't stress if it's broken.

**Why it matters:**  
It's quiet proof you're showing up. That's worth noticing.

## Common Actions (Quick How-To)

**How to edit an entry**  
Tap on any past entry in your archive. You'll see an "Edit" button. Change what you want, then tap "Save."

**How to delete an entry**  
Open the entry. Tap the three-dot menu or trash icon. Confirm "Delete." It's gone. No judgment.

**How to find past Hi Notes**  
Go to Home, then tap "Archive" or "My Hi Moments." Scroll or search by date. Everything you've logged is there.

**How to share (if available)**  
When you log a moment, you'll see a "Share?" toggle or button. Turn it on if you want to post it to the community. You can choose "Public" or "Anonymous." If you don't toggle it, your moment stays private.

**How to turn notifications on/off**  
Go to Settings. Look for "Notifications" or "Reminders." Turn them on if you want a gentle daily nudge. Turn them off if you prefer to check in on your own.

## If You Only Do One Thing…

Open the app. Pick two emojis (how you feel now, how you want to feel). Close the app.

That's it. Do that every day for a week and you'll start to see why this works.

## Troubleshooting (No Stress)

**"I don't know what to write."**  
You don't have to write anything. Just pick your emojis and move on. Words are optional.

**"I missed a day (or a week)."**  
That's fine. Just open the app today. The streak doesn't define you. Showing up again does.

**"I feel stuck or low and don't want to log it."**  
Log it anyway. Write "stuck" or "not great" and leave it at that. You don't have to fix it. Just acknowledge it.

**"I can't find my past entries."**  
Tap "Archive" or "My Hi Moments" from the Home screen. They're all there, organized by date.

**"Notifications are annoying."**  
Turn them off in Settings. The app works fine without them. Check in when you want to, not when your phone tells you to.

**"I don't see the point yet."**  
That's okay. It takes about a week to notice the difference. Try it daily for 7 days, then revisit this question.

**"I want to delete my account."**  
Go to Settings → Account → Delete Account. Your data goes with it. No questions asked.

**"I shared something I regret."**  
Go to the post, tap the menu, and delete it. It's gone from the community feed immediately.

**"I'm not sure if I did it 'right.'"**  
There's no "right." If you opened the app and did something — anything — you did it right.

**"Someone waved at my post and I don't know what that means."**  
It's a quiet acknowledgment. Someone saw your moment and wanted to say "I see you." No response required.

**"I feel pressure to post publicly."**  
Don't. Most people keep 80% of their moments private. This app is built for you first, community second.

**"The app feels too simple."**  
That's the point. Simple means you'll actually use it.

## On-Brand Closing

You don't need to be perfect. You don't need to have it all figured out. You just need to show up — one moment at a time.

This app isn't going to fix your life. But it will help you notice it. And noticing is where everything starts.

Open it when you can. Log what's real. Trust that small, consistent actions add up to something you'll be glad you kept.

You've got this.

Stay Hi.
