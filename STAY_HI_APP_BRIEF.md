# Stay Hi App — Brief

## What It Is (1–2 sentences)

Stay Hi is a daily momentum app that helps you check in with yourself, log real moments, and quietly build confidence through small, intentional actions. It's designed for people who want to feel more present and purposeful — without the noise.

## The Promise (1 sentence)

You'll remember more of your life, and you'll like who you're becoming.

## Who It's For

- People who want to feel more grounded but don't have time for long routines
- Anyone who's tired of performative social media but still wants to capture life
- Humans navigating transitions (new job, breakup, health changes, quarter-life reset)
- People who know they "should journal" but never stick with it
- Anyone rebuilding confidence after a quiet season

## The Problem It Solves (short paragraph)

Most people don't remember most of their days. We scroll through hundreds of other people's curated moments, but we rarely pause to acknowledge our own. Journaling feels like homework. Meditation apps feel preachy. Social media feels exhausting. What's missing is something simple: a place to check in with yourself, capture what's real, and see your own patterns without judgment or performance pressure.

## The Stay Hi Method

- **Check in with yourself** — Pick two emojis: how you feel now, and how you want to feel. That's it.
- **Log a Hi Moment** — A sentence, a photo, a location. Something real from your day.
- **Build a quiet streak** — Not for likes. For you. You'll see your momentum grow.
- **Reflect when you're ready** — Your personal archive shows patterns you'd never notice day-to-day.
- **Connect lightly (optional)** — Share anonymously or publicly if you want. Wave back or send peace to others. No comments, no pressure.

## Key Features (bullets, written like benefits)

- **Daily emotional check-ins** — See where you started and where you're headed, one day at a time
- **Hi Moments archive** — Your life, logged in simple entries you'll actually want to revisit
- **Streak tracking** — Build consistency without guilt or gamification gimmicks
- **Hi Scale badges** — Gentle intensity markers (1–5) that help you notice your energy patterns
- **Anonymous community sharing** — Post publicly or stay private — your choice, every time
- **Wave & Peace reactions** — Simple, non-verbal ways to acknowledge someone's moment
- **Location memory** — See where you were when you felt what you felt
- **Zero algorithmic feed** — Your moments are chronological, not "optimized for engagement"

## What Makes It Different

- **No toxic positivity** — You don't have to "manifest" anything. Just show up.
- **No comments or DMs** — Community exists, but it's not about conversation. It's about presence.
- **Built for private use first** — Sharing is optional. Your archive is yours.
- **Designed to feel calm** — No notifications begging you to "complete your streak." Just open when you're ready.
- **Made for real people** — No influencer culture. No "thought leaders." Just humans being human.
- **You own your data** — Export anytime. Delete anytime. No algorithmic tricks.

## Brand Voice (Do / Don't lists)

**Do:**
- Be direct and warm
- Use "you" language (not "users")
- Speak like a trusted friend, not a life coach
- Acknowledge hard days without fixing them
- Keep it simple — one idea per sentence
- End with "Stay Hi" when it feels right

**Don't:**
- Say "journey" or "transform your life"
- Use corporate speak ("leverage," "solutions," "empower")
- Overpromise results
- Treat people like they need saving
- Use excessive emojis (one is enough)
- Sound like a meditation app

## FAQ (5 Q&As)

**Q: Is this a journaling app?**  
A: Not exactly. It's lighter. Think of it as a daily check-in tool with a memory. You can write as much or as little as you want. Some days it's just two emojis. That counts.

**Q: Do I have to share my moments publicly?**  
A: Nope. Everything is private by default. You choose what to share, when, and whether it's anonymous or public. Most people keep 80% of their moments private.

**Q: What if I miss a day?**  
A: Nothing happens. No guilt trips. No "you broke your streak" shame. You just pick up whenever you're ready. Consistency matters, but so does being human.

**Q: How is this different from Instagram or BeReal?**  
A: No comments. No likes. No DMs. No endless scrolling. No algorithm deciding what you see. It's built for reflection, not performance. You can share if you want, but the app works perfectly if you never do.

**Q: Who made this?**  
A: Joe Atang (Help Inspyre / Hi). It started as a personal tool to stay grounded during transitions, and became something worth sharing. It's designed by someone who actually uses it every day.
