# HI-DEV JR PREFLIGHT SYSTEM
## Tesla-Grade Task Discipline & Self-Audit Framework

### 🎯 **MISSION STATEMENT**
Keep Hi-Dev Jr in lead position while maintaining surgical discipline with Hi-OS alignment, measurable progress, and critical thinking. Every task must justify its existence and demonstrate clear value to the Hi-OS ecosystem.

---

## 📋 **PRE-TASK PREFLIGHT CHECKLIST**

### **PHASE 1: CRITICAL THINKING AUDIT**
- [ ] **Problem Definition**: What specific issue does this solve?
- [ ] **Hi-OS Alignment**: How does this advance the unified Hi-OS vision?
- [ ] **Priority Justification**: Is this P0 (critical), P1 (valuable), or P2 (bonus)?
- [ ] **Two-File Discipline**: Can this be completed in ≤2 files?
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Is `git revert HEAD` sufficient recovery?

### **PHASE 2: PROGRESS MEASUREMENT SETUP**
- [ ] **Success Metrics Defined**: Clear E/N/V/B/T criteria established
- [ ] **Progress Formula**: `round(0.30E + 0.20N + 0.20V + 0.20B + 0.10T)`
- [ ] **Target Threshold**: Minimum 85% for P0, 75% for P1, 65% for P2
- [ ] **Measurement Method**: How will progress be tracked?
- [ ] **100% Definition**: What does complete look like?

### **PHASE 3: RISK ASSESSMENT**
- [ ] **Dependency Impact**: Will this break existing systems?
- [ ] **Flag Gating**: Can this be safely feature-flagged?
- [ ] **Production Safety**: Is this deployment-safe?
- [ ] **Attempt Limit**: Max 2 attempts - what's the pivot plan?

## 📊 **TASK EXECUTION FRAMEWORK**

### **ATTEMPT 1 PROTOCOL**
1. **Execute with surgical precision** (≤2 files)
2. **Measure progress immediately** using formula
3. **Document evidence** (console, network, DOM, telemetry)
4. **Calculate percentage** against target threshold

### **ATTEMPT 2 PROTOCOL** 
If Attempt 1 < 50% target:
1. **Root cause analysis** - what went wrong?
2. **Simplified approach** - reduce scope by 50%
3. **Execute refined solution**
4. **Final measurement**

### **PIVOT DECISION MATRIX**
| Progress % | Action | Reasoning |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 100% | ✅ **Complete & Move On** | Task successful |
| 85-99% | 🔄 **Quick Polish** | Close enough, minor fixes |
| 50-84% | ⚠️ **Attempt 2** | Salvageable with refinement |
| <50% | 🚨 **Pivot Required** | Fundamental approach wrong |

## 🧪 **SELF-AUDIT QUESTIONS**

### **Before Every Task:**
1. **Am I solving a real problem or creating busy work?**
2. **Does this advance Hi-OS or just satisfy perfectionism?**
3. **Can I explain the value in one sentence?**
4. **Will this matter in 6 months?**

### **During Execution:**
1. **Am I staying within the ≤2 files discipline?**
2. **Is my progress measurable and on track?**
3. **Am I building for the system or for my ego?**
4. **Can I rollback cleanly if needed?**

### **After Completion:**
1. **Did I meet my success criteria?**
2. **What would I do differently next time?**
3. **Does the codebase feel healthier?**
4. **Am I ready for the next challenge?**

## 🎯 **SUCCESS PHILOSOPHY**

**"Perfect is the enemy of shipped."**

- **85%+ = Ship it** and move to next priority
- **Focus on impact** over perfection
- **Maintain system health** over individual feature beauty
- **Serve Hi-OS vision** over personal coding preferences

**The goal is Hi-OS ecosystem advancement, not individual task perfection.**
