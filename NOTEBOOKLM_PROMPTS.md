# NotebookLM Prompts for Stay Hi App Content

## Prompt A: Step-by-Step "How to Use" Video Guide

```
Create a 2-3 minute video script for a "How to Use the Stay Hi App" tutorial. The video should be warm, clear, and non-technical — perfect for someone opening the app for the first time.

Structure the script in this order:

1. **Opening (10 seconds)**
   - Quick intro: "This is Stay Hi. Here's how to use it in 2 minutes."

2. **The 60-Second First Run (30 seconds)**
   - Walk through: Open app → Get Started → Pick two emojis → Done
   - Emphasize: "That's it. You just used Stay Hi."

3. **The Daily Flow (90 seconds)**
   - Show the 6 steps in order:
     - Open the app
     - Quick check-in (two emojis)
     - Pick your Hi intensity (1-5 scale)
     - Log a Hi Moment (one sentence)
     - Optional: Leave a Hi Note
     - Glance at your streak
   - For each step, narrate: "What you'll see → What to do → Why it matters"

4. **Key Reminder (15 seconds)**
   - "If you only do one thing: pick two emojis every day. That's enough."

5. **Closing (15 seconds)**
   - "You don't need to be perfect. Just show up. Stay Hi."

**Tone:**
- Direct and friendly (like a trusted friend explaining something)
- No corporate speak or buzzwords
- Calm, confident, human
- Use "you" language throughout

**Visual Notes for Video:**
- Show simple screen mockups or icons for each step
- Keep text minimal on screen (narration does the heavy lifting)
- Use the Stay Hi brand colors: calm gradients, clean typography
- Include the sign-off: "Stay Hi" at the end

Output a complete voiceover script with scene descriptions.

## Prompt B: Infographic "How to Use Stay Hi"

Design a one-page infographic titled "How to Use the Stay Hi App (Step-by-Step)." The infographic should be scannable, visual, and easy to understand at a glance.

**Layout Structure:**

**Top Section: "The 60-Second First Run"**
- 4 icons in a horizontal row showing:
  1. Open app → 2. Get Started → 3. Pick two emojis → 4. Done

**Middle Section: "The Daily Flow (2 Minutes)"**
- 6 numbered steps in a vertical or circular flow:
  1. Open the App

  4. Log a Hi Moment (one sentence)
  5. Leave a Hi Note (optional)
  6. Check Your Streak

## Prompt C: Video Breakdown of the Stay Hi App

```
Create a 3-4 minute video script that explains what the Stay Hi app is, why it exists, and what makes it different. This is NOT a tutorial — it's a product explainer / brand story video.

Structure the script in this order:

1. **Hook (15 seconds)**
   - "Most people don't remember most of their days. This app changes that."
   - Set the problem: we scroll through other people's lives but don't acknowledge our own

2. **What It Is (30 seconds)**
   - "Stay Hi is a daily momentum app. You check in with yourself, log real moments, and quietly build confidence through small actions."
   - Show: app screens (Home, Check-In, Hi Moment)
   - Emphasize: "It's private first. Sharing is optional."

3. **The Problem It Solves (45 seconds)**
   - Journaling feels like homework
   - Social media feels performative
   - Meditation apps feel preachy
   - What's missing: a simple place to check in with yourself and see your own patterns
   - "Stay Hi is that place."

4. **The Stay Hi Method (60 seconds)**
   - Walk through the 5 principles:
     1. Check in with yourself (two emojis)
     2. Log a Hi Moment (something real from your day)
     3. Build a quiet streak (for you, not for likes)
     4. Reflect when you're ready (your archive shows patterns)
     5. Connect lightly (optional community with waves & peace reactions, no comments)
   - Use on-screen text + narration

5. **What Makes It Different (45 seconds)**
   - No toxic positivity ("You don't have to manifest anything. Just show up.")
   - No comments or DMs (community without pressure)
   - Built for private use first (sharing is a choice, not a requirement)
   - No algorithm (chronological feed, no engagement tricks)
   - You own your data (export or delete anytime)

6. **Who It's For (20 seconds)**
   - "This is for people who want to feel more grounded but don't have time for long routines."
   - "For anyone navigating transitions, rebuilding confidence, or just wanting to remember their life."

7. **The Promise (15 seconds)**
   - Big on-screen text: "You'll remember more of your life, and you'll like who you're becoming."

8. **Closing (15 seconds)**
   - "You don't need to be perfect. You just need to show up — one moment at a time."
   - "Stay Hi."

**Tone:**
- Warm, confident, human (like Joe is speaking directly to you)
- No corporate buzzwords ("synergy," "transform," "disrupt")
- Emotionally resonant but not preachy
- Direct language, short sentences

**Visual Notes for Video:**
- Mix of app screen recordings, simple animations, and text overlays
- Show real (or realistic) Hi Moments from users
- Use calm, grounded visuals — no hype, no flashy effects
- Brand colors: gradients, clean typography
- Include "Stay Hi" signature at the end

Output a complete voiceover script with scene descriptions and visual cues.
