# ðŸ”— Magic Link Production Fix

## CRITICAL: Update Supabase Redirect URL

Your friend's magic link was redirecting to localhost because the Supabase auth configuration still has development URLs.

### Fix Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your Stay Hi project

2. **Navigate to Authentication â†’ URL Configuration**
   - In left sidebar: Authentication â†’ URL Configuration

3. **Update Site URL**
   - Change from: `http://127.0.0.1:5500`  
   - Change to: `https://stay-hi.vercel.app`

4. **Update Redirect URLs**
   - Remove: `http://127.0.0.1:5500/**`
   - Add: `https://stay-hi.vercel.app/**`

5. **Save Changes**
   - Click "Save" 
   - Changes take effect immediately
